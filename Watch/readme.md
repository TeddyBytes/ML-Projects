## Introduction

This project uses various machine learning models to classify exercises such as Bench Press, Overhead Press, and Deadlift based on sensor readings. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and eliminate highly correlated features.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the following Python libraries. You can use pip to install them:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
