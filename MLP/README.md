# Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for Word Prediction

This project implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using PyTorch to predict the next character in a sequence of characters from a list of words. The model is trained on a dataset of names, demonstrating basic techniques in deep learning, including batch normalization and mini-batch training.
