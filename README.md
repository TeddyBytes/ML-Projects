# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of my machine learning projects, covering a wide range of applications from natural language processing to image recognition and manual implementations of machine learning algorithms.

## Bigram
- **Description:** A manual implementation of a bigram model.

## BioMed
- **Description:** Built a model to detect health deficiencies using various preprocessing techniques and model evaluations.
- **Summary:** 
  - Logistic Regression performed well with standardization, but additional preprocessing slightly decreased performance.
  - KNN showed significant improvements in all metrics with preprocessing.
  - Decision Tree benefited from further preprocessing, while Random Forest maintained consistent results.
  - Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, SVM, and XGBoost models had minor fluctuations in performance, but generally underperformed compared to Logistic Regression and KNN.
  - KNN imputation was preferred over mean/mode/median imputations due to better model performance.

## Business Recommendation System
- **Description:** Developed a hybrid recommendation system on the Yelp dataset, integrating neural collaborative filtering and NLP for user review analysis.
- **Features:**
  - BERT tokenization and KMeans clustering for feature engineering.
  - PCA for dimensionality reduction.
  - Weights & Biases Sweeps for hyperparameter tuning and TensorBoard for training metrics analysis.

## CIFAR-10
- **Description:** A basic model for detecting images on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## GWhizGPT
- **Description:** Developed a mini transformer language model (decoder only).

## MLP
- **Description:** Hardcoded a multi-layer perceptron.

## Manual_Backprop
- **Description:** Manual implementation of backpropagation along the lines of Andrej Karpathy's makemore series.

## Watch
- **Description:** Built a fitness tracker using Scikit-learn, NumPy, and SciPy.
- **Features:**
  - Improved workout detection accuracy using advanced feature extraction (Fourier Transforms, PCA, and outlier detection).
  - Developed an ML pipeline with ensemble methods, Grid Search, and Time Series Cross-Validation for optimal model selection.

## Wavenet
- **Description:** Language model based on Wavenet architecture with near copy-paste implementations of various layers, including Linear, BatchNorm1d, and Embedding.

## WizNet
- **Description:** Manual implementation of a neural network called WizNet, including features like Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh activations.
- **Features:**
  - Includes visualization of backpropagation via the dot product, leveraging Karpathy's micrograd visualizations.

## Iris
- **Description:** Image classification using the Iris dataset.

## Bigram (again)
- **Description:** Another manual implementation of a bigram model.
